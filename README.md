# sneaker-raffle-script

This project attempts to automates entries for sneaker raffles, by using Selenium WebDriver to programmatically fill out a web form using data from a CSV file containing dozens of user profiles. The script loops through each entry, mimicking human interaction to avoid detection, and ensured accurate and efficient form completion. Streamlined what would have been a repetitive, manual task into a fully automated process.
